        One reason for branches in a Git repository is that they isolate development
        activities among team members. Another is that it ensures code changes are
        verified before they're delivered to other developers.

        Inheritance is when child classes can use functions/data from any parent

        Polymorphism is when a derived class can redefine a function of a parent class.
        Encapsulation is what determines what can have access to data within a

        In the integration manager workflow, developers have their own repositories to push to
        while in the dictator and lieutenants workflow, developers push to their assigned
        lieutenant repository.
j.
        Not everyone is allowed to push to the central repository and therefore
        reduces the chances of a ton of conflict occuring if 100 people are
        all trying to push into one directory. Instead by having the two lietenant
        repositories that go into the dictator repository, conflicts are solved earlier
        on at a smaller scale.
